# IITK-Mini-MIPS
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of the IITK-Mini-MIPS processor â€” a simplified, single-cycle MIPS-like architecture designed as part of the CS220 course at IIT Kanpur, under the guidance of Prof. Debapriya Basu Roy. 

The processor supports a custom ISA (instruction set architecture) with separate instruction and data memories, 32 general-purpose registers, and 32 floating-point registers. The processor executes all instructions in a single clock cycle using a streamlined datapath and control logic.
